📘 Matthew Jarrett – Computer Science ePortfolio (CS 499 Capstone)
👋 Professional Self-Assessment



Overview

I am a Computer Science graduate with hands-on experience designing, implementing, and securing full-stack applications. Through my coursework at Southern New Hampshire University and the development of my capstone project, Scribe’s Nook, I have strengthened my skills in software engineering, algorithms and data structures, database systems, and secure application development.

Throughout the program, I collaborated with peers through discussions, peer reviews, and structured project milestones. These experiences improved my ability to communicate technical concepts clearly to both technical and non-technical audiences, adapt designs based on feedback, and make informed trade-offs between performance, maintainability, and security.

My coursework emphasized real-world problem solving, including mobile application development, database-backed systems, REST APIs, authentication, and secure data handling. I developed a strong appreciation for defensive programming practices and designing systems with security and privacy in mind.

This ePortfolio represents my growth as a developer and showcases my ability to integrate multiple computer science disciplines into a cohesive, production-style solution.

🧩 Capstone Project: Scribe’s Nook

Scribe’s Nook is a full-stack mobile application that allows users to:
