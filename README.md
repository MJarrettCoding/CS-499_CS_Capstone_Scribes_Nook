## Computer Science ePortfolio — CS 499 Capstone

---

## 👋 Professional Self-Assessment

I am a Computer Science graduate with hands-on experience designing, implementing, and securing full-stack applications. Through my coursework at Southern New Hampshire University and the development of my capstone project, **Scribe’s Nook**, I strengthened my skills in software engineering, algorithms and data structures, database systems, and secure application development.

Throughout the program, I collaborated with peers through structured milestones, discussions, and peer reviews. These experiences improved my ability to communicate technical concepts clearly to both technical and non-technical audiences, adapt designs based on feedback, and evaluate trade-offs between performance, scalability, and maintainability.

My coursework emphasized real-world problem solving, including mobile application development, RESTful APIs, authentication, and database-backed systems. I developed a strong security mindset, focusing on defensive coding practices, authentication, authorization, and protecting user data.

This ePortfolio represents my growth as a developer and demonstrates my ability to integrate multiple areas of computer science into a cohesive, production-style solution.
